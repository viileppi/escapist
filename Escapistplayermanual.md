# Escapist player manual v.0.1



Thank you Sela, barcelona1937, Antti and DalaiLamer for your input and thanks for Richard Falken for tipping me about the MiniSix system. Escapist is still in very immature phase, but developing rapidly. Please join at #escapist-ooc @ darkmyst and please follow http://viileppi.blinkenshell.org/escapist.html for news.


## Introduction
> It is another rainy night in Mexico City, it always rains. You look out from the window of your gritty 9 square foot apartment seeing endless sea of neon lights. Your smartwatch notifies it is soon 2300 and time to go online. As you plug in the connector to the port mounted at back of your head, you feel slight electric sensation through your body.

> System check: OK. You click “go” and world goes blank as you lose the feeling of your body. Within few seconds, the Heads Up Display pops up and you can see the boot sequence printing in front of your eyes, but then comes the darkness again. Soon you get the grip of your senses again and you start to see blurred image. As the darkness passes completely, the image begins to come clear. There is outlines of bunch of characters: a furry cartoon fox dressed like a space pirate, two identical pale-skinned little girls with raven hair and a monk with glowing eyes with a semitransparent gender-neutral humanoid figure. This is your gang, the Bytefiddlers. They greet you with the usual meme punchlines and heartwarming laughter. You are in the virtual world now, in the world of no laws and no limitations of elementary physics.


## Background
It is the year 2050 and nobody can deny climate change anymore. Coastal cities are flooded and storms wipe the continent. Winter can come without a warning and last for years. Fossil fuels and uranium are almost completely drained, but nuclear fusion produces enough electricity for the 10 billion people around the world. Famine and viral epidemics are within everyday life. A healthy organic meal costs half of a latest iPhone, but mass produced TV-meals are handed out basically free (and so is the access to the virtual world). The word on the streets is that governments are just puppets to the global mega corporations. Artificial intelligence has passed the turing test decades ago. Your every move is monitored with cameras, microphones and RDIF-chips.

Within a last decade, virtual reality took a giant leap and a whole new artificial world, the Webz, has been created on top of the common internet. This is where everyone is at: at the morning you have your breakfast and log in, you fly to the work on virtual spaceship, work a whole day in virtual office and come home to logout briefly for a dinner. Then you log back in to spend a wild night at the red LED’s district with unimaginable vice and formication. That is, if you’re lucky enough to have a job. Automation has taken most the manual labor and majority of people live in the ghettos on welfare, spending most of their lives killing time online. Free-thinkers say, that this is the way to keep masses off from the real issues and to monitor them around the clock, but nobody seems to give a crap as long as they can have fun. For many people, cyber prostitution or fighting on an arena for entertainment are the only ways to earn an extra dime.
The only law of the Webz is not to piss off those who have more power than you, that is the Government or Corporates. Logging in is relatively safe: you can die while online if you go to the psychosis known as cipher syndrome. Cipher syndrome is when you start to believe that the virtual world is the real world and the real world is just an illusion.

The underground movement is stretching all around. Activists, terrorists and revolutionaries are pushing their common goals bringing chaos in to the real and virtual world. You can buy anything you can imagine from black market, even intercontinental nuclear missile if you have enough dough! With the changes in the world, the activism has changed too. Ecological activists don't just chain themselves to the trees - they hit arctic oil rigs with military grade anthrax starting new oil crisises.

Within all this monitoring and control, it is ironic, that the most valuable of all the resources is the information. You can get fortunes just by stealing college text books from Amazon, or cracking personal information on Google and selling it to the highest bidder. Since aggressive software patenting, all the open source and freeware software is considered illegal, so most people choose the free ChromeOs, but unfortunately it limits you to the very basic behaviour at the Webz.


## Characters
There is two characters to make: the real world character and his/hers online avatar. Only abilities that pass from the real world to virtual are Wit and Charm. Within real world you’ll have very limited skills and abilities due the lack of education and decent nutrition, but your avatar is not limited by those. Looks of the avatar has to go hand-in-hand to the abilities so that for example strong character has to look strong too, otherwise only your imagination is the limit. Note that avatar has to be 0.5m-4m in size. It mandatory to choose at least one complication for your character such as socially awkward, physically weak or drug addiction. Avatars don’t have complications.

You have to choose your alignment, this is for both your character and avatar, on axis of white hat - grey hat - black hat (good-neutral-bad) and on axis of corporate-freelancer-anarchist (lawful-neutral-chaotic). For example white hat anarchist could be an online activist, grey hat freelancer a mobs paid cracker and black hat corporate might be a businessman with psychopathic traits. Discuss about your profession and alignment with your GM. Check out the example character sheet.


> A word about the game mechanics, refer to Mini Six manual for more information:
> Each attribute is given in D6’s, so when you use that attribute you’ll throw equal amount of D6’s. For example if you do a melee attack with might of 2D and with melee skill of 1D, you will throw total of 3 times D6 (regular six-sided dice) and your opponent (who has might of 1D and dodge of 2D) will throw 3 times D6 to dodge your attack.


### Some example avatars:
Police.
* Corporate-white hat
* Might 3D+1	
* Wit 2D+1
* Agility  4D	
* Charm 2D
* Brawling 5D, Dodge 5D, Stealth 5D, Throw 5D, Computers 1D
* 2 mem, 4 quota
* Laser, Freeze, Trace, Lock


Cracker
* Anarchist-black hat
* Might 2D
* Wit 3D+1
* Agility 3D+1
* Charm 2D+1
* Dodge 3D+1, computers 3D+1, brawling 2D
* 4 mem, 6 quota
* Block 6 Dodge 6 Parry 6 Soak 6 CR 10
* Null, Laser, Editor, AI, Overflow, Double


Con man
* Freelancer-grey hat
* Might 2D	
* Wit 4D
* Agility 2D	
* Charm 5D
* Computers 3D, seduction 3D, bluff 2D+1
* 2 mem, 4 quota
* Block 6 Dodge 6 Parry 6 Soak 6 CR 10
* Editor, AI, cloak, grep


## Attributes
One of the most important ability for avatar is cyber resistance (CR) that determines how well avatar can stand virtual attacks. CR equals average of your avatars might and your characters programming/computer skills, times three. Everybody and everything has cyber resistance in the virtual world, for example a virtual safe containing passwords could have CR of 18 -you have to roll more to crack it open.

For the character distribute 12 dices over 4 attributes (might, agility, wit and charm). For avatar copy wit and charm from character and distribute 8 dice to might and agility. Each dice can be splitted to 3 perks, +1 to each. Perks can be spent freely on any ability but there can be only +3 on each -rest has to be dixes.
Skills

For your avatar you might want to choose skills in weaponry, martial arts and acrobacy. These can be bought too later on. You can pass the online security measures with acrobatic moves and battle with enemies kung-fu.

Allocate 7 dices over skills you prefer. Again, a dice can be split into perks. Here are some generic examples: acrobatics, bluff, decipher, diplomacy, martial arts, programming, search, seduction, shooting.

You can buy more avatar skills or try to learn them. Level 1D skill is 500MU and the price will increase in exponent of two, so level 2D skill will cost 2500MU. It is also possible to steal skills with disassembler if you take over somebody’s avatar. Roll your programming skill; you can have the stolen skill this many turns.

> The wild dice: one of the dices (or the dice if you throw only one dice) is a wild dice. This means if you get a 6 with that dice, you can keep throwing more with the wild dice. On the other hand, if you get 1 you’ll fail miserably with consequences. Wild dice is different color than the other dices.

Characters in the real world are limited to projectile and melee weapons such as shotguns and baseball bats. You cannot dodge a bullet in the real world. Deal with it.

## Operating systems
### Terminology
Mem: how much memory the player has to use commands per turn. Everyone starts with 2 mem. You can run as many commands as your programming skill is (if you have enough mem). Mem can be bought more.

Quota: how many commands you can pack with you. Everyone starts with 4 quotas, more can be bought.
Chrome OS
Free. Default for users. Cannot load battle- or programming-oriented commands. Mostly useless in action, but safe way to visit the virtual world.

### RTOS (real-time operating system)
Cost: 200MU. You will choose ASM or C as your programming language. You must have programming ability at least 2D to use RTOS. RTOS users can run 1 extra command per turn.

Commands
* Move (experience > 2): move objects within range of sight, can be used to yourself too.
* Copy: copy inanimate objects
* Double (experience > 4): Double your mem for a turn. Takes one turn to load, unless you kick start it -then it will take two turns to recover and you cannot use any commands at that time.
* Zip: pack three commands to one quota. Takes a turn to unzip the commands.
* Cloak: disguise
* Timer: a countdown timer for any command


### NIX
Cost: 400MU. You will choose C or Python as your programming language. You must have at least 4D at your ability to program to use NIX. Nix has many one-purpose commands that can be combined nicely.
Commands
* grep: will highlight the things you want to see
* cron: a timed program, either a countdown or repeat at given interval
* mv: move objects, can be used to yourself too
* cp: copies inanimate objects
* wildcard: one command applies to many targets
* loop: repeat command given times, maximum of 3 times a turn
* break: stops loop
* pipe: sends command or result of command to another command or to another place in sight
* if: conditional for any command
* script: a series of commands executed in order. Can be stopped with break.
* trace: traces a user, takes 3 turns to complete and cannot be done hidden.
* kill: ends user connection. A melee maneuver.
* tar: pack 4 commands to one quota. Takes a turn to unpack.
* AI: simple artificial intelligence

### Scheme machine
Cost: 600MU. Scheme machine is the oddball of operating systems, it is simple and complicated at the same time. It is slow but it can be used to make very advanced AI’s. All programming are done in Scheme-language. You must have programming ability of 6D or more to use Scheme machine.
* Advanced AI: making an AAI requires separate avatar sheet for AI. AI’s intelligence is determined by its makers programming skill.
* List: a structure where you can put just about anything, can also have branches. You can place a clever attack sequence in a list in forehand and execute it when needed without overloading your mem. You can put as many things in list on a turn as you have mem.
* If: a conditional
* Null: nullifies the attacks
* Recursion: a program can call itself and multiply or loop. You can loop with recursion up to 5 times a turn. but beware if you don’t put if-command in it you cannot stop it.
* Define: a subprogram
* Size: change size of objects
* Antigravity: use gravity at your will
* Telepathy: control AAI with your will

### Commands for every OS (except Chrome OS)

* Invisibility (xp level 3)
* Hologram
* Process list
* Editor (exp > 4): gives a possibility to change parameters of objects in sight.
* Lock: locks a weapon or command to target, +2D for a try
* Simpleton AI: a very simple and limited AI.
* Halt: stops user from logging out for a turn
* delete: delete your running command

### Malware
Malware must be written in the same OS as the target is running. 

Virus: make your command or script spread it self. Creators programming level decides viruses CR
Trojan: disguise any script or command to harmless looking object
Rootkit: a takeover of avatar




## Cyber health
Characters who spend lot of time online can suffer from a cipher psychosis, then they cannot tell real world apart from the virtual one. All sorts of physical conditions can arise from laying around connected all day. Being social online does not fulfill characters all needs for social interaction. Keep these variables in mind so that your organic central processing unit will stay in tune. You have to disconnect at least once a day for a meal. Being online more than 12h at time doubles the risk of psychosis.

## Drugs
In 2050 drugs are still illegal, but there’s very little effort to stop manufacturing, selling and using them. Because wide variety of designer drugs, each one is not described here. Instead they are split into main categories according their desired effect and usage scenario.

### virtual drugs
* wit increasing drugs
* agility increasing drugs
* drugs that allow you do twice the amount of commands per turn
* drugs that split your avatar in two (very dangerous for cyber health)


### real world drugs
* wit increasing drugs
* agility increasing drugs
* pain relieving drugs
* anxiety relieving drugs
* sleeping drugs
* alcohol: lowers all your capabilities

Each drug will increase the desired attribute, but after the effect wears out these attributes will lower for as long and as much the player decided to boost these abilities. Long term use will lower the attributes permanently. Each time player uses drugs, he/she must throw a 1D6 for addiction. If player rolls 1 the addiction kicks in and he/she is unable to get the desired effect, instead he/she must keep on using the drug or become completely useless. Addiction can happen on the very first time using the drug.

Drugs with +1D effect and duration of 3 turns cost 50MU a dose, as the effect and duration doubles the price increases in exponent of two so +2D drug with duration of 9 turns costs 250MU. Risk of addiction is the same regardless the price. 

### Making drugs
If player has chemistry skills, he/she can try to manufacture real world designer drugs. Simple drugs that increase abilities a little for short period of time are easy to make, but more efficient drugs are harder to make. Fail in drug making can lead to serious consequences. Online drugs are made with programming skills, unfortunately you cannot copy the drug like many other objects.
Entertainment
There is wide variety of online entertainment, all hosted by the megacorporate Sony. Avatars can earn a dime while fighting as a gladiator on the arena or blow their money on adult entertainment. There is virtual drugs that cause euphoria and hallucinations. One can also participate in interactive fiction scenes that will blow the mind in detail and carefully engineered plot twists.





## Transportation
### Real world
In the real world only transportation available is public transportation; electric busses, taxis, trains, boats and planes. Local transport such as bus or a subway is free, but longer distances cost a lot. Since airplanes are electrically powered propeller planes, the intercontinental flight costs a fortune. In the remote rural areas there is tractors and dirtbikes.

### Virtual world
In the webz there is wide variety of all sort of devices for moving avatars. With high experience levels you can use moving-commands to yourself or even do antigravity. For lower levels there is motorcycles, cars, aircraft and of course public transport that is lightning fast. You can be anywhere of the virtual world within seconds with lighttrain.
